# Simple-NeuralNetwork-Py

A very simple fully connected Neural Network implementation in Python based on the tutorials and the NN.js library by Danial Shiffman in this [playlist].

If you want some resources to learn about Neural Networks, I suggest checking these playlists and book:
* [Neural networks] By [3Blue1Brown]
* [Neural Networks - The Nature of Code] By [The Coding Train]
* [Make Your Own Neural Network] By Tariq Rashid

# To-Do List

* [x] Implmeneting the basic NN itself with only 1 hidden layer.
* [x] Train the library to solve XOR problem
* [x] Replace `matrix.py` with `numpy`
* [ ] Add more activation functions
* [ ] Train the library on the MNIST dataset
* [ ] Add support for multiple hidden layers
* [ ] Train the library to play games

# Documentation

* `NeuralNetwork` - The neural network class
    * `predict(input_list)` - Returns the output of the NeuralNetwork
    * `train(input_list, output_list)` - Trains the NeuralNetwork on the given input.
